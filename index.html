                <p>There is pure delight in pursuing a walk along the length of the Ganges River.  Flowing 2,500 kilometers from its source in the Himalayan Mountains to the Bay of Bengal, the river captures the heart of India's culture and civilization.</p>

                <p>Of particular enjoyment, is meeting the beautiful people who live along the rivers banks. They are some of the most hospitable people on earth.</p>

                <p>From time to time some friends have asked to join me in this adventure.  To enjoy the journey to the fullest, I have chosen to conduct the walk with a minimum of baggage.  Here is my complete list.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>simple backpack</li>
                    <li>simple bedsheet</li>
                    <li>one change of clothing</li>
                    <li>torch</li>
                    <li>odomous</li>

                <p>Sandals are my footwear of choice for this walk. Others may find an approach shoe more comfortable.  No matter what footwear you choose, the rule of thumb is that they should be well used before embarking on this journey.  Too many of my companions have turned up with a fairly new shoe and paid the price in blisters and sores.</p>

                <p>I will wear a new pair of sandals and everyday for six months before embarking on this journey. This has proved to be very helpful in keeping my feet happy.</p>

                <p>The towns along the Ganges have simple but affordable and  sufficient places for accommodation.  There are lots of options for food, road side vendors with delicious hot off the fire options as well as a variety of sit down restaurants. </p>
                
                <p>Once outside of the town areas, there is little in the way of restaurants or eating places along the banks of the Ganges River.  Part of the charm of the walk is experiencing the serendipitous encounters with the hospitable villagers of the Ganges.</p>

                <p>The hotels and restaurants in the towns have basic toilet amenities.</p>

                <p>Once away from the towns there is nothing.  Here a combination of good planning and creativity serve the purpose.</p>

                <p>These days, cell phone service is available in almost all locations. Indeed, mobile phone technology has become almost universally ubiquitous across most of India.  </p>

                <p>Indian mobile phone providers have made it possible to obtain a SIM card upon entry at various airports around the country.  This is the best place to obtain a local SIM card if you wish. These provide excellent phone and data coverage at a very reasonable cost.</p>

                <p>The Ganges River is a dynamic river. Every year during the monsoons (June to September) the river swells to a fanastic width, in places up to two kilometers in width. Erosion of the banks is an ongoing challenge to the farmers trying to make a living along the river. Sometimes whole fields are washed away as the river carves out a new channel. Sometimes temples, that used to be perched right on the rivers edge, are now hundreds of meters away from the river.  This meandering of the river means it is difficult for cartographers to keep up with the changes.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, it is good to consult a map to chart out the best side of the river to follow.  Online maps are usually more accurate as they have frequent updates from satellite imagery.</p>

                <p>As mentioned above, the hospitality of the villagers is phenomenal. I receive regular requests to stop for a cup of chai, a chat and a visit. People are curious about my journey and my destination. Many times I have had overnight accommodation arranged on a string cot in the home of a farmer.</p>

                <p>The word for guest in Hindi is "atithi" which comes from the idea of an unannouced guest (the situation long before any form of telecommunication). Mixed with this is the idea that the guest might be god, in some incarnate form.</p>

                <p>Some thoughts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be a respectful guest</li>
                    <li>Appreciate cultural differences</li>
                    <li>Show interest in your host and their family</li>
                    <li>Ask about their dance, music, literature, games</li>
                    <li>Find out about their social organization, beliefs, rituals</li>
                    <li>Don't worry, do your best</li>
                    <li>Make friends!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>All the major cities in India are well connected by train and by air. Many smaller towns throughout India are also on a train route of some kind. When a town is not on a train route, bus services are available.</p>

                <p>Outside of smaller towns, transportation becomes more interesting. Shared taxi, jeeps, autorickshaws and horse drawn tongas become the travel mode of choice. The seating capacity of any of these vehicles is usually pushed to the limit to accommodate the number of people needing a lift. One way or other, humans have learned to get from one point to another and you will always find a creative way to do so. One of the most inventive rides I have enjoyed was a water pump powered three wheeler.</p>
